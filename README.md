Design projects for DECO3500


## Timeline

In the [Design Proposal](Iteration1/Design_Proposal_Evaluation.md), feedback from tutor highlighted four main gaps:
1. **Definition** – "healthy food" is unclear, outcomes are hard to measure.
2. **Clarity** – success and engagement lack concrete metrics.
3. **Approach** – design focuses too much on app features rather than behavioral strategies.
4. **Target Scope** – audience is too broad; need a narrower group for impact.


Then our team [refined the focus](Iteration1/Refine_Proposal.md) on two user groups: **Food Sharers & Socializers** and **Healthy Eating Learners**. The core goal is enabling students to share recipes offline and cook together, making healthy eating social and fun.
We redesigned interview questions and gained clearer insights about user motivations and challenges.


From the following [Interview](Iteration1/Interview_Analysis.md):
Food emerged as a **social gateway** for students, especially newcomers: cooking together breaks the ice, reduces loneliness, and builds friendships more effectively than eating out. **Cultural exchange** through shared dishes fosters pride and curiosity. Peer demonstrations encourage trying new or healthier foods. Students value **inclusion, belonging, and memorable experiences** and prioritize atmosphere over food quality. Their challenges include loneliness, limited cooking skills, ingredient uncertainty, busy schedules, and shyness in group settings. Users need **low-barrier opportunities to cook together**, guidance on unfamiliar ingredients, and simple, social-friendly formats to balance convenience with fun.
