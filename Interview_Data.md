## Interviewee 1

1. What role does food play in your social life?
Hmm… honestly, food is kind of a big part of my social life. Since I just came to Brisbane, eating together is one of the easiest ways to connect with classmates or other international students. Like, if someone suggests “let’s grab dinner after class,” I usually join, even if I’m not super hungry.
Back in China, sharing meals was very normal, and I kind of miss that. Here, sometimes I feel a bit lonely eating by myself in my studio, so I go out for takeaway or eat at a food court just to be around people. When I cook, it’s usually just for myself, so it doesn’t feel that social—unless a friend comes over and we cook together, which doesn’t happen very often.
So yeah, I’d say food is like a way for me to make friends, try new things, and not feel isolated.
Can you share a story where food brought you closer to friends or helped you connect with new people?
Yeah… actually, I remember in my first week here, I joined a small meetup for international students. We didn’t know each other well, but after the event a few of us decided to go to Sunnybank for dinner. It was hotpot, and it felt very familiar to me—like back home.
We ended up spending hours there, talking about our countries, how we cook different dishes, and even laughing when someone tried really spicy broth for the first time. After that night, I felt much more comfortable with them, and we’ve kept hanging out since then.
So for me, sharing that meal made me feel less like a stranger in a new city. It was easier to open up when we were eating together, compared to just chatting in a classroom.

2. When you eat with others, what do you value most, and can you share a recent group meal that left a strong impression on you?
I think what I value most is the feeling of being included. When I eat with others, it’s not only about the food—it’s about sharing the experience, talking about our day, and sometimes even joking about cultural differences in what we eat. It makes me feel less alone here.
A recent group meal… hmm, yes. Just last weekend, a classmate invited me to a barbecue at South Bank. It was my first Aussie-style barbecue. I was surprised that people just brought sausages, bread, and salad—so simple compared to Chinese barbecue. At first, I didn’t know how to join in, but someone showed me how to cook the sausages on the grill. We ate together by the river, and it felt really relaxed.
That night stayed in my mind because it was my first time experiencing this kind of local food culture, and it made me feel like I was part of the group instead of just “the new student from overseas.”

3. How important is cultural food sharing for you?
It’s very important to me. Cultural food feels like a piece of home, so when I share it with others—or when they share theirs with me—it’s like exchanging parts of our lives.
For example, I once cooked a simple tomato and egg stir-fry for a friend here. It’s such a common dish in China, but she had never tried it before. She really liked it, and that made me feel proud and connected. At the same time, she taught me how to make a simple curry, which I’d never cooked before.
I think cultural food sharing helps me not only keep my identity but also learn about other people’s traditions. It makes friendships stronger, because we’re not just eating—we’re understanding each other’s backgrounds.
Can you recall a memorable experience of trying food from another culture?
Yes, I can. A few weeks ago, one of my classmates from India invited me to her place. She made dal with rice and some spicy potatoes. At first I was a little nervous, because I don’t usually eat food that’s very spicy, but the flavors were so different and comforting. She explained how her family cooks it back home, and I found it really interesting.
I enjoyed it so much that she even gave me some extra lentils and showed me how to cook it myself. After that, I tried making dal in my own studio—it wasn’t as good as hers, but it felt nice to cook something new. That experience was memorable because it wasn’t just about eating—it was about learning from a friend and feeling welcomed into her culture.

4. Would sharing and learning about food from other cultures make you more likely to try new ingredients or healthier options? For example, has a friend ever introduced you to a new recipe or ingredient? What happened?
Yes, definitely. When I see a friend cooking something from their culture, I feel more curious and willing to try it. If I just saw the ingredient in the supermarket by myself, I might feel confused or not know how to use it—but when a friend explains, it feels easier and less intimidating.
Like with the Indian dal I mentioned—before that, I had never bought lentils. I didn’t even know which kind to choose in Woolworths, because there are so many. But after my friend showed me, I went to buy red lentils and tried making the dish. Now I sometimes cook it when I want something simple and healthy.
So yeah, having that personal connection and guidance makes me more open to new ingredients. It also feels less risky—because I already saw how someone else cooked it and enjoyed it together with them.

5. What factors would make you more willing to cook with friends rather than just eating something casually on your own? Could you describe the last time you chose to cook with friends instead of eating alone casually?
I think the biggest factor is the social atmosphere. Cooking with friends feels like an activity, not just about filling your stomach. If I know someone is planning a meal and we can split the work, I’m much more motivated to join. It also feels less stressful, because we can share the cost and ingredients, and I don’t have to figure everything out by myself.
The last time I cooked with friends was about two weeks ago. A few classmates and I decided to have a “dumpling night” at my studio. We all brought something—one person bought dumpling wrappers, another brought vegetables and pork. We sat around the table making dumplings together, chatting, and laughing at the funny shapes we made. It took longer than just grabbing takeaway, but it was really fun.
That night, I ate more vegetables than I normally would, and it felt healthier. But honestly, the main reason I enjoyed it was the shared experience—it felt like home, and I didn’t feel so alone in Brisbane.

## Interviewee 2

1. What role does food play in your social life?
Hmm, food is actually quite important in my social life. When I eat alone in my studio, it feels quiet and a bit lonely, but when I share food with friends, it’s different. We can talk, laugh, and it makes me feel more connected. I remember once a classmate invited me to cook hotpot together. We all brought some ingredients, and it felt warm, like family dinner. That experience made me realize food is not only about filling the stomach, it’s also about company and friendship.
Can you share a story where food brought you closer to friends or helped you connect with new people?
Yeah, sure. When I first came to Brisbane, I didn’t know many people. One weekend I joined a small cooking event in the student accommodation kitchen. Everyone brought something from their own country. I didn’t know what to make, so I just cooked a simple Chinese fried rice.
At first I felt a bit nervous, because my English is not very good, and I thought maybe people wouldn’t like my food. But when I shared the fried rice, some students from India and Germany tried it and said it was tasty. Then they also explained their dishes to me, like dal and a kind of potato salad. We started talking about food back home, how our parents cook, and what we miss here.
That night, we didn’t just eat together, we laughed, exchanged recipes, and even planned to cook again the next week. After that, I felt less lonely. I became closer with them, and now we sometimes go shopping together to buy ingredients. So for me, food really helped break the ice and build friendships.

2. When you eat with others, what do you value most, and can you share a recent group meal that left a strong impression on you?
When I eat with others, I value the feeling of togetherness the most. It’s not really about the food being fancy or expensive. For me, it’s about sitting around the table, talking, and feeling relaxed. The atmosphere and the people matter more than the dishes.
A recent meal that impressed me was a barbecue night at a friend’s house. Everyone brought some ingredients — I brought vegetables and noodles, others brought meat and snacks. We cooked outside, listened to music, and shared stories about our countries. It was simple, but I really enjoyed it. I felt like I belonged to a small community here. That night gave me energy, and I didn’t feel so homesick.

3. How important is cultural food sharing for you?
I think cultural food sharing is very important for me. When I try food from another culture, I feel like I can understand people better. It’s not only about taste, but also about their story, tradition, and memories.
For example, one of my friends from Malaysia cooked a curry for us. While we ate, she told us how her family always cooked that dish for festivals. Listening to her story while tasting the curry made me feel closer to her. I also shared dumplings during Chinese New Year, and my friends liked making them together. It felt like we exchanged part of our culture, not just food.
So for me, cultural food sharing makes friendships stronger and helps me feel more connected in a new place.
Can you recall a memorable experience of trying food from another culture?
Yes, I can. One time I was invited to an Indonesian student gathering. They cooked a big pot of rendang, spicy beef stew. At first I was a bit worried, because I’m not used to very spicy food. But when I tried it, the flavor was rich, the meat soft, and I actually liked it a lot.
While eating, they explained how their families prepare rendang for special days, and they even showed me how to eat it properly with rice and side dishes. That moment was special, because I felt like I was not only trying food, but also joining their tradition. It made me feel welcomed and closer to them.
After that, I also invited them to my place to try dumplings. We made them together, and it became a fun cultural exchange. This experience really stayed in my mind.

4. Would sharing and learning about food from other cultures make you more likely to try new ingredients or healthier options? For example, has a friend ever introduced you to a new recipe or ingredient? What happened?
Yes, definitely. Sharing food and learning recipes from other cultures really makes me want to try new things. When I see my friends cooking something different, I feel curious, like, “maybe I can also do that.”
For example, one time my Indian friend invited me to his place and made dal. I had never cooked with lentils before. He showed me step by step — washing, boiling, adding spices. I watched and helped a little. The taste was so good, warm and healthy. After that, I went to the Asian supermarket to buy lentils myself. Now sometimes I cook dal when I don’t want to eat noodles again. It became part of my diet, and it’s cheap too.
Another time, my German classmate introduced me to rye bread with cheese and salad. At first I thought it was too plain, but when I tried it, I felt it was fresh and filling. It gave me the idea that not every meal needs to be hot or heavy. Sometimes a simple sandwich can also be healthy and fast.
So for me, cultural sharing is very helpful. If I just see ingredients in the shop, I don’t know what to do with them. But when friends show me, I get the confidence to try. And it makes eating more fun, because I connect the food with the story and the person.

5. What factors would make you more willing to cook with friends rather than just eating something casually on your own? Could you describe the last time you chose to cook with friends instead of eating alone casually?
I think the biggest factor is company. When I know I will have people to eat with, I feel more motivated to cook. Also, cooking together makes it less stressful, because everyone brings something or helps with small tasks. It feels lighter than cooking alone. Another factor is the atmosphere — when we plan a meal together, it feels more special, like an event, not just filling the stomach.
The last time I cooked with friends was about two weeks ago. We decided to make dumplings in my student accommodation kitchen. At first, I thought it might be too much work, but everyone helped — one person made the filling, some people rolled the dough, and I folded dumplings. While we worked, we talked, laughed, and even shared some funny stories from our classes. When we finally sat down to eat, it felt really warm. I ate more than usual, not just because of the food, but because of the feeling of being together.
That night, I didn’t feel lonely at all. Cooking with friends turned something ordinary into a very happy memory.

## Interviewee 3

1. What role does food play in your social life? Can you share a story where food brought you closer to friends or helped you connect with new people?
Em, food is really… important for me, because it feels like home, you know? When I came here to Brisbane, I didn’t know so many people, and I missed the taste from Germany a lot.
One time, I cooked Käsespätzle — it’s like German pasta with cheese — in my student accommodation kitchen. Some other students from different countries walked by and smelled it, and they asked me what I was making. We ended up cooking together, they brought some vegetables and I showed them how to make the noodles by hand.
After that, we started a small group where every week someone cooked food from their country. It helped me make friends faster, because even if our English is different, when we share food, it’s like… we understand each other. So, yeah, food makes me feel less lonely and more connected.

2. When you eat with others, what do you value most, and can you share a recent group meal that left a strong impression on you?
Em, when I eat with others, I value the… how to say… the feeling of being together, not just the food. Like, when people are relaxed, talking, laughing, and nobody is in a hurry. For me it is more about sharing time than eating fast.
A recent meal was last month — my flatmate is from India, and she cooked a big vegetarian curry with homemade chapati. We sat on the floor in our living room, because the table was too small, and everybody used their hands to eat. It was very new for me, but also very warm, very friendly. We talked a lot about traditions, and I felt included in something special. That evening, I think I understood more about her culture, and also I felt like we became closer friends.
Sometimes these simple group meals, they stay in my memory more than going to a restaurant.

3. How important is cultural food sharing for you? Can you recall a memorable experience of trying food from another culture?
Oh, em, cultural food sharing is really very important for me. Because when I am far away from home, I miss my own culture, but also I want to learn from others. Food is like an easy door — you don’t need perfect English to share it, you just cook, taste, and then talk a bit. It makes me feel connected in a way that is deeper than just small talk.
One memorable experience… hmm, I think it was during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. Some Chinese students invited me to join their celebration. They gave me mooncakes, and I never tried them before. At first, I was a bit surprised, because the filling was salty egg yolk with sweet paste — in Germany we don’t really mix like this. But after they explained the story about the moon, family reunion, and why people eat it, I felt like I was not just eating food but also learning a part of their tradition.
We sat outside, looked at the moon, and everyone shared stories about their hometown celebrations. I felt very emotional, because it reminded me of Christmas at home, when family comes together. That night I understood how food can carry feelings, memories, even history. It was not only about taste, but about belonging.
So for me, cultural food sharing is almost like a bridge. It helps me not only to enjoy new flavors but also to respect and understand people better.

4. Would sharing and learning about food from other cultures make you more likely to try new ingredients or healthier options? For example, has a friend ever introduced you to a new recipe or ingredient? What happened?
Yes, em, definitely. When I see how other people use ingredients, I feel more curious and less afraid to try. Before, I was more… how to say… traditional, I liked only the food I know from home. But here in Brisbane, meeting people from many countries, it changes me.
For example, one friend from Japan showed me how to cook miso soup. I never used miso paste before — I thought it is maybe too strong or expensive. But she explained how it is healthy, with probiotics, and good for digestion. We went together to the Asian supermarket, she showed me which brand is affordable. After that, I started cooking miso soup at home, sometimes with tofu and spinach, and it became a simple, healthy meal for me.
Another time, my Indian flatmate taught me to use lentils for dal. In Germany, I usually only ate lentils in thick winter soup, very heavy. But here, I learned how to make a lighter dal with spices. It is cheap, full of protein, and honestly helps me save money compared to buying meat.
So yes, sharing food really makes me open to new ingredients. And because friends explain the story and show me how, I feel motivated to keep trying — and sometimes I realize it is also healthier than what I cooked before.

5. What factors would make you more willing to cook with friends rather than just eating something casually on your own? Could you describe the last time you chose to cook with friends instead of eating alone casually?
Em, for me, the biggest factors are time, mood, and also who is around. If I have a lot of study work, sometimes I just eat bread with cheese quickly alone. But when I have a free evening, and maybe I feel a bit lonely, I want to be with people. Also, when I know my friends are bringing something special, like a family recipe, then I feel more motivated to join and cook together.
The last time was maybe two weeks ago. I was tired after class and thought, “Okay, I just make some pasta for myself.” But then my friend messaged in our group chat, “Hey, we are cooking Mexican tacos tonight, come if you want.” At first, I thought maybe I am too tired. But then I remembered how nice it feels to cook with them, so I went.
It was really fun. Everyone had a small job — one cut vegetables, another fried the meat, someone else made guacamole. I helped with grating cheese, even if I was laughing because the cheese here tastes so different than in Germany. We ate together, listened to music, and I ended up staying much longer than I planned.
If I had eaten alone, it would just be a quick, boring meal. But cooking with friends gave me energy and joy. It’s more about the atmosphere, the teamwork, and feeling like part of a small family here in Brisbane.

## Interviewee 4

1. What role does food play in your social life? Can you share a story where food brought you closer to friends or helped you connect with new people?
Hmm… food is a part of how I hang out with friends here. I don’t cook much, going out to eat feels like the easiest way to spend time together.
Like, in my first week after moving here, I didn’t really know anyone. My roommates asked me if I wanted to come with them to try this local burger place. I almost said no because I was nervous, but I went. And honestly, that dinner helped me open up. We all laughed about how huge the portions were compared to back home, and we stayed there for hours just talking. Now they’re some of my closest friends.
So yeah, I feel like food is my way of bonding. Cooking together hasn’t happened much yet because I don’t really know how, but eating out has definitely helped me connect with people.

2. When you eat with others, what do you value most, and can you share a recent group meal that left a strong impression on you?
I think what I value most is the feeling of not being alone. When I eat with others, it’s less about the food and more about the daily life, laughing, sharing stories, sometimes even complaining about classes together. It makes me feel like I belongs to here.
Recently, a few of international students had a party the common area. Everyone brought something simple from their culture such as dumplings, pasta, sushi. I felt so nice, everyone was curious about each other’s food. We not just sharing meals but also sharing stories about festivals and traditions from back home.

3. How important is cultural food sharing for you? Can you recall a memorable experience of trying food from another culture?
Oh, it’s really important for me. Food is a way to stay connected to my culture when I’m away from home. And when I share Indian food with others, it feels like I’m sharing a piece of myself like telling this is who I am.
One memorable experience was when my roommate, who’s from Mexico, invited me to try her homemade tacos. She cooked them herself and impressed me so much. She showed me how to eat them properly with all the toppings. It made me think of family dinners at home with my mom’s curry. It felt like we were both sharing our homes through the food.

4. Would sharing and learning about food from other cultures make you more likely to try new ingredients or healthier options?
Yeah, honestly, if I just see something new in the store, I probably won’t buy it because I don’t know if it’ll taste good. But if a friend from another culture suggest it, I will be happy to have a try.
Like, I had never eaten avocados bafore, and I thought they were kind of weird. But my roommate showed me how to mash them with lime and salt, and I found it tasty. It felt like a small step, but it made me realize I can try new things if someone guides me.

5. What factors would make you more willing to cook with friends rather than just eating something casually on your own? Could you describe the last time you chose to cook with friends instead of eating alone casually?
Hmm… I think what would make me more willing is if the cooking part feels easy and fun. And I think the social part really matters.
The last time I cooked with friends was actually pretty recent — a few of us decided to make cooikes together. We mix flour, sugar and butter together, shaped them into different shapes and put them in the oven.I think it’s way more fun than eating alone. For me, if cooking feels like a activity instead of a chore, I’m more likely to join in.

## Interviewee 5

1. What role does food play in your social life? Can you share a story where food brought you closer to friends or helped you connect with new people?
Honestly, food is kind of my way of connecting with people because I’m usually pretty shy. I’m not the type to start conversations easily, but when there’s food involved, it feels more natural.
Last semester, I joined a small cooking meetup on campus. Everyone had to bring one homemade dish, and I made Japanese karaage (fried chicken). At first, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone, but when people tried it and asked me how I cooked it, we started chatting. I ended up making a few friends there, and now we sometimes cook together on weekends. So yeah, food definitely helps me open up.

2. When you eat with others, what do you value most, and can you share a recent group meal that left a strong impression on you?
For me, it’s not just about the food but the atmosphere. I really value when everyone feels relaxed and included, even if we don’t know each other that well.
A few weeks ago, I went to a hotpot dinner with some classmates after a group project. It was my first time having Australian-style hotpot — a bit different from Japanese nabe. We all cooked together, shared ingredients, and even taught each other little tricks. I remember laughing so much that night, and it made me feel closer to everyone.

3. How important is cultural food sharing for you? Can you recall a memorable experience of trying food from another culture?
Cultural food sharing is actually really meaningful to me because I think food tells a lot about someone’s background and lifestyle.
I remember once my friend from India invited me to her house and cooked homemade dosa for us. I had never tried it before, and she also showed me how to eat it with different chutneys. It felt so warm and personal, like I was learning a little piece of her culture through food. Since then, I’ve been more curious about trying different cuisines.

4. Would sharing and learning about food from other cultures make you more likely to try new ingredients or healthier options?
Definitely yes! I think when you know the story behind a dish or ingredient, you naturally want to try it.
For example, one of my friends introduced me to quinoa last semester. I had no idea how to cook it before, but she showed me a simple recipe, and now I make it for my lunches sometimes. It’s healthy, filling, and kind of fun to experiment with. Learning from friends makes me more open to trying new things.

5. What factors would make you more willing to cook with friends rather than just eating something casually on your own? Could you describe the last time you chose to cook with friends instead of eating alone casually?
Honestly, I enjoy cooking alone sometimes because it’s relaxing, but cooking with friends is different — it feels more fun and meaningful.
The last time I cooked with friends was during mid-semester break. Three of us decided to make sushi together. We spent the afternoon preparing rice, slicing salmon, and laughing at how messy our rolls looked at first. Eating together afterward felt so rewarding because we made everything ourselves. That experience made me realize cooking together isn’t just about food — it’s about sharing time and creating memories.
