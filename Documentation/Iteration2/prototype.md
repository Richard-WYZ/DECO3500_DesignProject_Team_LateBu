# Functional Prototype Progress

## Implemented Functionalities

- **Public Kitchen Reservation**: Users can complete reservations on the lobby or elevator screen with a single drag.
- **Activity Info & Health Index**: By clicking an activity, users can view participant numbers and health index information, helping students understand the relationship between diet and health.
- **Cooking Instructions in Kitchen**: The kitchen screen displays relevant cooking information, assisted by the AI helper.
- **Illustration Generation & Printing**: The AI generates illustrations based on participation and other related information, which can be printed out from the kitchen printer.
