# Ethical Considerations

Throughout the design and evaluation of **NutriMate**, we applied ethical reflection following *Loke & Matthews (2020)* and the Ethical Disclaimer Canvas framework.  
Our goal was to ensure that the system promoted inclusivity, transparency, and user autonomy within shared student kitchen environments.

Key ethical issues identified include:

- **Privacy and Consent** — Users book anonymously, raising potential concerns about traceability and data use. We ensured that no personal data is stored and that QR codes only link to session-specific information.  
- **Social Pressure and Inclusion** — Cooking together may unintentionally exclude less confident participants. To mitigate this, the interface encourages flexible participation and equal visibility of all users.  
- **Responsibility and Transparency** — We reflected on our role as designers to communicate system limitations clearly, avoiding unrealistic expectations about social impact.  

As part of ongoing reflection, we also considered future risks related to data management, AI-generated visuals, and the sustainability of digital infrastructure.  
This ethical awareness guided our design choices, ensuring that NutriMate fosters social connection responsibly rather than reinforcing exclusion or surveillance.
