# Ethical Considerations

## 1. Overview

Ethical thinking is central to interaction design. Following **Loke & Matthews (2020)**, designers are not only creating functional systems but also shaping the social contexts and values surrounding technology use. As creators of NutriMate, we recognize that our work influences how students connect, share, and interact within shared living environments. Therefore, it is our responsibility to anticipate potential ethical risks and ensure that our design empowers rather than constrains users.

## 2. Ethical Risks and Implications

| Category | Description | Example in NutriMate |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **Privacy & Data** | The system collects and displays user activity information, which may expose participation data. | Students may not want others to know when or with whom they are cooking. |
| **Social Pressure** | Group participation may lead to anxiety or fear of rejection. | A user may hesitate to join public sessions if they fear being excluded. |
| **Representation & Inclusion** | The design might unintentionally overlook cultural or dietary diversity. | Recipes or illustrations could reflect limited cultural perspectives. |
| **Technological Dependence** | Overreliance on the system could replace natural, spontaneous interaction. | Students might only connect via the app rather than face-to-face. |
| **Public Visibility** | Displaying sessions publicly could pressure users into social exposure. | Names or participation might be inferred from visible activities. |

## 3. Mitigation Strategies (Based on the *Ethical Disclaimer Canvas*)

| Ethical Dimension | Design Response |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Transparency** | The booking interface clearly communicates data use; login is not required. |
| **Informed Consent** | All participants in research and evaluation provided informed consent and could withdraw at any time. |
| **Privacy-by-Design** | No identifiable data is stored; all participation records are anonymous and local. |
| **Inclusivity** | Cooking events and visual materials represent diverse cultural contexts and food traditions. |
| **Empowerment** | Users maintain control over whether to scan QR codes or share activities; participation is voluntary. |
| **Reflection** | The design team held reflective sessions after each iteration to document ethical decisions and social implications. |

## 4. Reflection Using *Loke & Matthews (2020)* Framework

| Dimension | How NutriMate Addresses It |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| **Responsibility** | The team continuously reflects on how NutriMate may affect social behaviors and community inclusion. |
| **Accountability** | Each design iteration includes documentation of ethical decisions and justifications in the project wiki. |
| **Transparency** | Users are informed about how information is generated and used (e.g., QR codes only verify bookings). |
| **Inclusivity** | The interface and activity types are designed to be accessible to all students regardless of culture or background. |
| **Reflexivity** | The team acknowledges its biases and regularly revisits assumptions through user feedback and peer discussion. |

## 5. Future Ethical Considerations

As NutriMate expands to more campuses and kitchens, new ethical questions may emerge. We plan to monitor and adapt the design accordingly:

- **Data Ownership:** Users should have the ability to delete or export their data if future versions introduce accounts.  
- **Social Dynamics:** Continued observation of how the system affects inclusivity and peer relationships.  
- **AI Illustration Bias:** Regularly evaluate AI-generated content to ensure it does not reinforce stereotypes or cultural bias.  
- **Public Exposure:** Reassess how event visibility affects user comfort and autonomy.  
- **Sustainability:** Ensure that hardware components (printers, displays) align with environmentally responsible practices.

## 6. Summary

NutriMate’s ethical approach goes beyond “doing no harm.” Our goal is to **empower users and strengthen community** while protecting their privacy, autonomy, and diversity. By applying both the *Ethics for Interaction Design* framework and the *Ethical Disclaimer Canvas*, we maintain a reflective and responsible design process that prioritizes transparency, inclusivity, and respect for participants.
