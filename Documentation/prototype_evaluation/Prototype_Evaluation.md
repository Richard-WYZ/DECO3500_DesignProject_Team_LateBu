# Evaluation Protocol – Social Cooking System Prototype

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this evaluation is to explore how users interact with the social cooking system prototype in a realistic shared environment. The focus is on understanding how the system supports or hinders social interaction, collaboration, and engagement among users during the activity cycle of booking, participating, and completing a cooking event.

This is a **formative evaluation**, aiming to identify areas for improvement and design implications rather than to validate usability or satisfaction scores.

## 2. Evaluation Design

| Dimension | Method | Goal |
|------------|--------|------|
| Real task performance | **Scenario Walkthrough** | Observe how users complete the full workflow from booking to completion |
| Behavioral and social interaction | **Observation** | Record how participants collaborate, communicate, and share tasks |
| Cognitive process | **Think-Aloud (embedded)** | Capture participants’ thoughts when making decisions or facing confusion |
| Emotional and reflective response | **Post-Interview** | Explore users’ feelings, social experiences, and suggestions |

---

## 3. Participants

- **Target group:** International students or apartment residents who use shared kitchens.
- **Group size:** 3–4 pairs (6–8 participants total).
- **Setting:** Simulated apartment common area (for event booking) and shared kitchen (for cooking activity).

Participants should have some experience with shared facilities and interest in social activities.

---

## 4. Evaluation Scenarios

Three connected scenarios are used to represent the entire user experience:

| Scene | Description | Objective |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **Scene 1: Booking an activity** | Two students view the lobby display and scan the QR code to register for a cooking event. | Assess how clearly the system communicates events and whether it lowers the barrier for participation. |
| **Scene 2: Cooking together** | The pair enters the kitchen, scans their ticket, and follows on-screen steps to complete the meal. | Examine how the system facilitates collaboration, coordination, and communication. |
| **Scene 3: Completion and reflection** | After finishing, the system generates an AI illustration which participants print as a souvenir. | Observe whether the feature enhances social bonding and sense of achievement. |

---

## 5. Procedure

| Phase | Duration | Method | Description |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Introduction** | 2 min | Briefing | Explain the purpose of the session, emphasizing that the system is being tested, not the participants. |
| **2. Scenario Walkthrough + Observation** | 10–15 min | Main phase | Participants complete the full scenario together while the researcher observes and records. |
| **3. Embedded Think-Aloud** | 2–3 min | Optional | When a participant browses or makes a decision individually (e.g., selecting an event), prompt them gently to verbalize thoughts. |
| **4. Post-Interview** | 5–8 min | Reflection | Discuss overall experience, comfort level, and potential improvements. |
| **5. Wrap-Up** | 2 min | Closing | Thank participants and explain data handling. |

**Estimated total:** 25–30 minutes per pair.

## 6. Data Collection

| Data Type | Collection Method | Purpose |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Video / Audio | Recording of the scenario walkthrough | Capture behavior, conversation, and non-verbal interaction |
| Field Notes | Researcher observation log | Record actions, social cues, and notable moments |
| Think-Aloud transcript | Audio recording | Identify user reasoning and confusion points |
| Interview notes | Written or recorded | Capture emotional and reflective feedback |

---

## 7. Observation Focus

The observation will emphasize the following aspects:

1. Who initiates actions or leads decisions.
2. How participants share roles or coordinate tasks.
3. Any hesitation, silence, or awkwardness.
4. How naturally the system integrates into the physical space.
5. Signs of enjoyment, engagement, or frustration.

---

## 8. Post-Interview Questions

Semi-structured interview questions:

1. Did the system help you collaborate or talk more naturally with your partner?
2. Which part of the process felt easiest or most confusing?
3. Was there any moment when you felt uncomfortable or unsure how to proceed?
4. Did the experience make the cooking activity more fun or meaningful?
5. What would you change or add to improve it?

---

## 9. Data Analysis

| Layer | Goal | Example Focus |
|--------|------|----------------|
| **Behavioral** | Identify interaction patterns and collaboration roles. | Task division, turn-taking, engagement levels |
| **Cognitive** | Understand user reasoning and problem-solving. | Think-Aloud content, confusion points |
| **Emotional** | Capture user affect and reactions. | Smiles, laughter, tone, or tension |
| **Design Implications** | Translate findings into design improvements. | Social flow, communication aids, environmental fit |

---

## 10. Ethics

- Obtain participants’ informed consent for recording.
- No sensitive or personal data will be collected.
- Participants may withdraw at any time.
- Data will be used only for academic purposes.

## 11. Findings & Design Implications

### Finding 1 – Lack of Booking Feedback and User Ownership

**Observation:**  
Users were uncertain about the booking process because it was anonymous and login-free. They wanted to know whether their booking succeeded, how to cancel, and how to check updates.

**Interpretation:**  
The absence of feedback reduced the sense of control and continuity.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Include a QR code on the printed ticket that links to a mobile confirmation page showing event details and a cancel option.

**Design Implication:**  
Provide lightweight personal linkage between booking and participation to increase trust and engagement.

---

### Finding 2 – Unclear Preparation Requirements Before Activities

**Observation:**  
Participants were unsure what utensils or ingredients to bring to the kitchen, causing hesitation before the activity.

**Interpretation:**  
The system lacks practical preparation information connecting the digital booking to physical readiness.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Add a “Preparation Tips” section on the activity detail page and include the same info via the ticket QR code.

**Design Implication:**  
Bridge the digital–physical gap by offering preparation guidance for smoother participation.

---

### Finding 3 – Persistent Social Discomfort Despite System Mediation

**Observation:**  
Participants tended to interact with the screen rather than with each other, relying on system instructions instead of conversation.

**Interpretation:**  
The interface supports organization but not social bonding; it structures activities without stimulating interpersonal comfort.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Add subtle social prompts or shared micro-tasks (e.g., “Ask your partner to choose the next step”).

**Design Implication:**  
Shift from functional coordination to social engagement by embedding social cues into task flow.

---

### Finding 4 – Lack of Micro-Scale Social Options

**Observation:**  
Participants wanted control over who they cook with and preferred small, familiar groups.

**Interpretation:**  
Open participation can cause discomfort and reduce motivation for engagement.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Add a “Join with a friend” or “Small group mode” option in booking to allow personalized pairing.

**Design Implication:**  
Support users’ preference for small, comfortable social settings by offering flexible group formation.

---

### Finding 5 – Missed Social Reinforcement After the Activity

**Observation:**  
Participants enjoyed the AI-generated illustration but rarely shared or discussed it afterward.

**Interpretation:**  
The experience ends at completion; there is no mechanism for post-event reflection or social continuation.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Add a post-event page or social wall accessible via the ticket QR code for sharing illustrations or messages.

**Design Implication:**  
Extend social connection beyond the activity to sustain engagement and community continuity.

1. Identification of design barriers and enablers for social interaction.
2. Insights into collaboration patterns and emotional engagement.
3. Actionable design implications for prototype iteration and refinement.
