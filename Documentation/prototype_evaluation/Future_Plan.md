# Future Plan

## 1. Overview

The development of *NutriMate* has demonstrated the potential to transform shared cooking spaces into social, collaborative environments.  
Based on our evaluation findings and exhibition feedback, the next stage of our work will focus on **enhancing scalability, personalization, and long-term engagement**.  
Our goal is to evolve the prototype into a more adaptive and sustainable system that can be deployed and tested in real shared living contexts.

## 2. System Refinement

### 2.1 Booking and User Identification

We plan to refine the booking process by introducing a **lightweight user identification system**.  
While maintaining the anonymous and open nature of NutriMate, users will be able to **track their bookings**, **manage cancellations**, and **receive event updates** through a **QR code printed on the ticket**.  

Currently, the QR code does not link to an active confirmation page. In the next development stage, we plan to design and implement a **mobile confirmation interface** that displays booking details and allows users to check or cancel their participation.  

This feature aims to improve the sense of continuity and ownership without requiring account registration.

### 2.2 Preparation Information

In future iterations, we will enhance the **activity detail page** with clearer preparation instructions, including required tools and ingredients.  
The same information will also be displayed on the planned **mobile confirmation page** linked to the ticket’s QR code, helping participants prepare confidently before the activity.

## 3. Social Interaction Enhancement

### 3.1 Encouraging Natural Conversation

To strengthen interpersonal engagement, we will introduce **contextual social prompts** during cooking activities—small interactive cues such as “Share one of your cooking tips” or “Ask your partner to choose the next ingredient.”  
These micro-interactions aim to make the experience more spontaneous and reduce social hesitation.

### 3.2 Group Flexibility

We plan to implement a **“Join with a friend”** and **“Small group mode”** feature, enabling users to form or join micro-communities before events.  
This addition supports users who prefer smaller or familiar groups, addressing the need for comfort and autonomy observed during evaluation.

## 4. System Expansion and Scalability

One recurring suggestion from the exhibit was to allow users to **create and upload their own events**.  
In future iterations, we plan to add this capability, empowering students or community managers to host personalized cooking sessions.  
This will help the platform scale organically and encourage diverse participation.

## 5. Evaluation and Real-World Testing

The next step will involve conducting **longitudinal evaluations** in real apartment environments.  
This phase will focus on:

- Measuring how the system influences **social connectedness** over time,
- Assessing the **sustainability** of participation and engagement, and  
- Gathering feedback for continuous iteration.

## 6. Future Vision

In the long term, NutriMate aims to become a **social infrastructure platform** for everyday communal activities.  
By extending beyond cooking, it could connect residents through shared hobbies, workshops, and wellness events—continuing to strengthen interpersonal ties in community living spaces.  

Ultimately, our vision is to design **technology that encourages face-to-face interaction**, transforming digital interfaces into tools that foster real human connection.
