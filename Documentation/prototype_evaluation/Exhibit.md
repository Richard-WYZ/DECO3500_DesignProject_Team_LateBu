# Exhibit

## 1. Overview

The **Exhibit** marks the final stage of our project, where we publicly showcased the *NutriMate* prototype to peers, instructors, and visitors.  
The exhibition provided an opportunity to communicate our design concept, demonstrate interactive features, and collect real-time feedback from a wider audience.

Our goal for this stage was to:
- Present the complete user journey from **booking → participation → reflection**,  
- Engage participants in an **interactive demonstration**, and  
- Gather **new insights** about the usability, social interaction, and communication aspects of the prototype in an open setting.

## 2. Preparation

To effectively communicate the project concept, we created an **introductory website** serving as a promotional and explanatory platform.

### Intro Website
The website presented:
- **Project concept and motivation** – addressing social isolation and participation barriers in shared student kitchens.  
- **Design process** – summarizing our research, prototyping, and evaluation phases.  
- **System features** – including the booking interface, cooking assistant, and AI-generated illustration module.  
- **Prototype interaction** – The website also provides the link of the prototype.

This preparation ensured that visitors could explore the idea even before interacting with the physical prototype.

## 3. Exhibition and Presentation

During the exhibit, the entire team actively participated in:
- **Setting up the prototype display**, combining the prototype screen, printed ticket function, and intro website.
- **Delivering live demonstrations**, showing how users can book, cook, and print souvenirs.
- **Engaging in discussions** with peers and visitors to explain the design goals and research background.
- **Answering Q&A sessions** from tutors and other participants, emphasizing the social design and iterative development process.

The interactive setup attracted attention and encouraged participants to try the system themselves, simulating the experience of a shared cooking event.

## 4. Audience Reactions and Feedback

Visitors and instructors appreciated the project’s:
- **Holistic design** connecting physical and digital experiences, and
- **Clear connection to real social challenges** in student housing environments.

However, several feedback points emerged during the exhibit:

1. **Unclear Physical Flow** – A few people were unsure about how the “booking–cooking–printing” sequence works in a real environment without guidance.  
2. **Scalability Concerns** – Questions arose about how the system could handle multiple groups or larger kitchens simultaneously.  Some pointed out the current system do not have a function that users can upload their own activities. 

These insights complement the findings from our formal evaluation and will inform potential future refinements.

## 5. Reflection and Learning Outcomes

Through the exhibition, the team gained valuable experience in:
- Translating research and prototypes into communicable public artifacts;  
- Managing real-time audience interaction and feedback;  

The exhibit also revealed the importance of:
- Simplifying communication materials for non-technical audiences;  
- Preparing visual aids and physical artifacts that reinforce the story;  
- Observing spontaneous reactions as a natural extension of evaluation.
