## Foundation

### Motivations, Aims & Outcomes  
NutriMate was created to **transform shared student kitchens into social, cultural, and inclusive spaces**.  
Our aim was to address loneliness and disengagement in student accommodation by **using cooking as a social catalyst**.  

**Key Motivations**
- Encourage meaningful interactions in everyday settings.
- Support healthy and affordable eating habits through shared learning.
- Celebrate cultural diversity in food practices.  

**Expected Outcomes**
- A hybrid digital–physical prototype that fosters spontaneous and organized cooking events.
- A social system that encourages participation without demanding high technical literacy.

---

### Inspiration  
Early ideation was guided by **previous studies of social computing and communal living**, revealing that:
- Food is a universal icebreaker.
- Physical environments strongly influence social interaction.
- Shared kitchens are underused due to uncertainty, lack of social cues, and unclear ownership.

**Reference Projects:**  
- Campus kitchen bulletin boards.
- QR-based social platforms in shared spaces.
- Peer-to-peer recipe sharing systems.

---

### Site  
Our **site of design** was the **student dormitory kitchen** — a semi-public, low-trust environment often avoided due to social anxiety and logistical confusion.  

The project explored:
- Kitchen spatial layout and flow.
- Points of visibility (bulletin boards, lobby screens).
- Transition areas (elevator, hallway) as **social opportunity zones**.

---

### People  
**Target Group:**  
International and domestic students living in shared dormitories, often experiencing:
- Isolation due to cultural/language barriers.
- Low confidence in approaching others.
- Limited cooking skills or time.

**Engagement Methods:**
- Semi-structured interviews (Iteration 1–2)
- Observational studies of kitchen activity
- Prototype evaluations with users cooking in pairs or groups

---

### Resources  
Our design relied on accessible, low-cost materials and platforms:
- Existing dormitory infrastructure (walls, displays)
- QR-based digital entry system
- Mini-program prototype (no installation required)
- Printable promotional artifacts and visual guides

## The Experience Itself

### Theme & Narrative  
The narrative behind NutriMate centers on **shared cooking as social storytelling** — each meal tells a story of origin, belonging, and participation.  
The experience follows a *“Cook Together” journey*:  
**Reserve → Scan → Cook → Celebrate.**

This structure translates the everyday act of meal preparation into a collaborative, culturally rich event.

---

### Nodes (Points of Interaction)  
**Physical Nodes**
- **Community Recipe Wall:** Students post recipes and QR codes to digital details.  
- **Kitchen Display:** Shows active events, available times, and social prompts.  
- **Ticket Printer:** Offers tangible, shareable reminders of participation.  

**Digital Nodes**
- **Mini-program:** For booking events, browsing recipes, and finding buddies.  
- **Social Feed:** Allows post-event reflection and sharing.  

---

### Trajectory (User Journey)
1. **Discovery:** Student notices a kitchen event poster or board.  
2. **Engagement:** Scans QR code → registers interest → views participants.  
3. **Preparation:** Receives tips, ingredients, and schedule via confirmation page.  
4. **Participation:** Cooks together, guided by app + social prompts.  
5. **Reflection:** Receives AI-generated souvenir photo; shares feedback.

This journey intertwines **physical and digital affordances**, turning passive space into an active community hub.

---

### Tools  
- **Hybrid Interaction Tools:** QR code linking physical and digital elements.  
- **AI Features:** Nutrition analysis, recipe suggestions, souvenir generation.  
- **Evaluation Methods:** Think-aloud sessions, interviews, behavioral observation.  
- **Promotional Materials:** Posters, interactive website, and conference display.

---

### Public Face  
The **NutriMate identity** communicates warmth, inclusion, and playfulness.  
- Logo and color palette draw from kitchen and ingredient motifs.  
- Public exhibition setup recreated the dorm environment, inviting hands-on demos.  
- Poster and promotional site served as key outreach tools linking concept → prototype → evaluation.

---

## Evaluation & Reflection  

Using the location framework encouraged us to constantly **revisit the relationship between place, people, and interaction**.  
### Evaluation Highlights:
- **Physical space constraints** shaped social comfort zones.
- **Digital tools** lowered participation barriers.
- **Cultural diversity** enriched recipe sharing and engagement.

Findings informed redesigns focusing on **micro-social opportunities**, **contextual prompts**, and **privacy-aware participation**.

## Summary  
NutriMate embodies **design for location** — a system that thrives within, and is defined by, its environment.  
Through iterative exploration of **place, interaction, and narrative**, the team crafted a location-aware, socially responsive cooking experience that transforms everyday spaces into social catalysts.
