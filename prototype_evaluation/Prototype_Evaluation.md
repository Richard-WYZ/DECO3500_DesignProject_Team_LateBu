# Prototype Evaluation

### Overview

During prototype testing, we observed several usability and engagement issues that highlight gaps in both **social** and **mobile** aspects of the current NutriMate experience. The following summarizes the key findings, derived user needs, and proposed improvements.

---

## 1. Limited Attention in Noisy Spaces

**Finding:**
Students often encounter the lobby or elevator display in **noisy, fast-moving environments**, where their attention span is short. As a result, they may miss key information about upcoming cooking events.

**User Need:**
Information should be **concise, glanceable, and easily actionable** within seconds.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Use **visual effect** like bold themes for instant recognition.
- Add **motion cues or animations** to draw attention.

---

## 2. Schedule Conflicts with Diverse Timetables

**Finding:**
Students have **diverse class timetables**, causing many to miss suitable cooking sessions.

**User Need:**
The system should **adapt to individual availability** and help users discover sessions that fit their schedules.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Enable **calendar syncing** with university timetables.
- Offer **AI-based time suggestions** based on a user’s free slots.
- Provide a **“Join waitlist”** or **“Suggest new time”** feature to encourage flexible participation.

## 3. Forgotten Registrations

**Finding:**
After scanning a QR code to sign up, students often **forget about the event**, due to a lack of timely reminders.

**User Need:**
A **mobile follow-up system** that reinforces commitment and anticipation.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Send **push notifications** or **chatbot reminders** before the event.
- Offer **one-tap calendar integration** at sign-up.
- Display **countdown widgets** in the mobile app or dorm lobby screens.

---

## 4. Complex Interface and User Flow

**Finding:**
The current UI requires guidance; new users struggle to navigate between **screens, QR systems, and physical tools** in the kitchen.

**User Need:**
A more **intuitive, guided onboarding experience** that bridges physical and digital touchpoints seamlessly.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Introduce **step-by-step visual onboarding** or **tutorial mode**.
- Apply consistent design and simplified interface.
- Provide **contextual help prompts** via the mobile app and kitchen display.

---

## 5. Lack of Participant Visibility

**Finding:**
Users expressed a desire to **see who else is joining** the same cooking event to feel more comfortable and socially motivated.

**User Need:**
Increase **social awareness and transparency** around group composition.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Show **participant profiles or avatars** on both lobby and mobile interfaces.
- Allow users to **filter or join by shared interests, languages, or dietary needs**.

---

## 6. Limited Post-Event Social Continuity

**Finding:**
After the co-cooking session, social interaction tends to **fade quickly**, making it hard to form lasting connections or communities.

**User Need:**
A mechanism for **ongoing engagement and community building** beyond the cooking event.

**Potential Improvements:**

- Enable **photo sharing**, **chat groups**, or **follow-up challenges**.
- Reward repeat participation with **digital badges or collections**.
