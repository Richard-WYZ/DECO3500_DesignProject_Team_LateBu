# Week 5-6 Team Update

This week, we dive deeper into **user research**. We narrowed our target groups to:
- **Food Sharers & Socializers** (primary)
- **Healthy Eating & Cooking Learners** (secondary)

Our main goal remains the same: **helping students share healthy recipes offline and cook together**. We believe this makes healthy eating more fun, social, and engaging.

## Recent Progress

- According to tutor's feedback, we **redesigned our interview questions** to better capture users' needs.
- Each team member ran **one new interview**.
- We have a clearer picture of what motivates students and the challenges they face when they are cooking and sharing their food.

## Next Steps

By next Wednesday, we plan to:
1. **Analyze interview data** to identify key features for the platform.
2. **Sketch low-fidelity prototypes**, and moving toward hi-fi designs after feedback.

The team responsibilities:
- **Data analysis**
- **User journey mapping**
- **Feature brainstorming**
- **Finding design inspirations**
- **Prototyping**

## Challenge

Our biggest question right now: **How do we make the social aspect strong enough?**
We're exploring ways to encourage students not only to share recipes online, but also to actually **meet offline, cook together, and build a real community around healthy eating**.
