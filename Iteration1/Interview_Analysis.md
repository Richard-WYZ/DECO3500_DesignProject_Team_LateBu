# Interview Analysis

## Key Insights

- **Food as a social gateway**: For newly arrived students, eating and co-cooking are low-pressure icebreakers that help build friendships fast (mentioned by Li, Wang, Y, Anna, Priya).
- **Belonging > the dish itself**: Relaxed, inclusive atmospheres and shared preparation create stronger bonds than restaurant meals alone (BBQ, hotpot, dumpling/taco/sushi nights recur).
- **Cultural sharing drives “try-new + healthier”**: When a friend demonstrates a recipe, students are far more willing to try unfamiliar or healthier ingredients (lentils/dal, quinoa, miso, rye bread, avocado).
- **Living alone + decision fatigue**: Studio living and “what should I eat?” overwhelm lead to takeaway or repetitive simple meals (Li, Wang, Priya).
- **Substitutes & price sensitivity**: Students struggle to find familiar ingredients or equivalent taste/texture locally (Anna, Kenji, Y); they want affordable, accessible substitutes.
- **Event friction**: Students want to cook together but lack organization scaffolding (planning, splitting tasks/costs, timeboxing), so events happen inconsistently.

## Key Points

- **Food as Social Connector**: Eating together helps break the ice, reduce loneliness, and build friendships (especially for international students).
- **Cultural Exchange**: Sharing food from home builds pride, identity, and curiosity about others.
- **Cooking Together as an Activity**: Group cooking feels fun, like teamwork, and makes meals feel more special than eating alone.
- **Guidance Encourages Exploration**: Students are more willing to try new/healthy ingredients if a friend explains or demonstrates how to use them.
- **Atmosphere more important than Food Quality**: Relaxed, inclusive environments matter more than fancy dishes.

## Pain Points

- **Loneliness when eating alone** (especially in studios).
- **Limited cooking skills and confidence** prevents some from hosting or joining cooking sessions.
- **Uncertainty with unfamiliar ingredients** when shopping alone.
- **Busy student schedules** → defaulting to takeaway or simple meals.
- **Nervousness and shyness** when joining group meals (language, cultural barriers).

## User Values

- **Inclusion & Belonging**: Feeling part of a community through shared meals.
- **Cultural Identity**: Pride in sharing food from home, and curiosity in learning about others.
- **Friendship Building**: Cooking and eating together strengthens bonds more than casual meetups.
- **Learning & Growth**: Discovering new ingredients, recipes, and healthier habits through peers.

## User Needs

- **Opportunities to cook together easily** (low-barrier activities, shared costs, simple planning).
- **Guidance for new ingredients/recipes** (peer-led demos, cultural exchanges).
- **Social-friendly cooking formats** (dumpling nights, taco nights, hotpot, barbecues, etc.).
- **A way to feel included quickly** (especially for newcomers who may feel isolated).
- **Balance of convenience & fun** (not too much effort, but still engaging).
