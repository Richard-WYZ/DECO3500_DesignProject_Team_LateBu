# Design Proposal Feedback Summary & Future Plan

## Feedback Summary

### 1. Definition Gap
- The concept of **“healthy food”** is not clearly defined in our project.  
- Without a shared definition, it’s hard to measure whether our app helps users eat “healthier.”

### 2. Clarity of Success & Engagement
- Unclear what **“engagement”** means in the app (e.g., posting, liking, cooking together?).  
- Unclear what **success** would look like (e.g., more cooking at home, less takeaway?).  
- Need to specify criteria to evaluate impact and effectiveness.

### 3. Design vs. Approach
- Presentation focused too much on **application features**.  
- Explore different **approaches** to solving the problem (e.g., behavioral nudges, gamification, peer-led learning), not just UI concepts.

### 4. Target User Scope
- Current target group (all UQ students, especially internationals) is **too broad**.  
- Risk of trying to meet everyone’s needs → diluted impact.  
- Suggested: narrow focus to **one specific group** of users.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. Define "Healthy Food" Clearly
- Establish a **practical, student-friendly definition** of healthy eating.  
  - Example: *“Balanced meals under $10 with vegetables + protein, quick to cook in under 20 minutes.”*  
- Base definition on evidence (WHO guidelines, Australian health recommendations) but keep it simple for students.

### 2. Set Clear Success Metrics
- Define what counts as success:
  - **Behavioral**: fewer takeaway meals, more home-cooked meals.  
  - **Engagement**: number of recipes shared, challenges completed, group interactions.  
  - **Health outcomes**: improved food literacy (knowing how to cook/use ingredients).  
- Decide which metrics the app will track and evaluate.

### 3. Explore Approaches Beyond Design
- Consider **behavioral and motivational strategies** alongside app features:
  - Nudges (push reminders: *“3 friends tried this $5 healthy recipe today”*).  
  - Gamification (weekly streaks, badges for cooking at home).  
  - Peer accountability (friends cooking challenges, group shopping trips).  
- Show different **approach directions** before finalizing design.

### 4. Narrow the Target User Group
- Instead of “all UQ students,” choose **one clear segment**:
  - Example A: *First-year international students in Brisbane, struggling with local supermarkets.*  
  - Example B: *Budget-conscious students living off-campus who want quick meals.*  
- Build the app **for them first**, then expand later.

## Next Step
Refine our project pitch to highlight:
1. A clear, student-friendly definition of “healthy food.”  
2. A narrowed target user group (likely international students new to Brisbane).  
3. Measurable outcomes for engagement and success.  
4. Different approaches (not just features) we’re considering.
