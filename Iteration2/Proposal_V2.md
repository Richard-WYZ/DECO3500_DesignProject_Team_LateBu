## 1. Target User Group Refinement

Mainly **international students in student dormitories**, with characteristics and needs such as:

* **Language diversity**: English may be the common language, but not necessarily fluent; native languages may differ.
* **Social needs**: Desire to make friends, but cultural differences and shyness may make it hard to initiate.
* **Daily life needs**: Need solutions for meals, sharing recipes, and learning simple and practical cooking methods.
* **Sense of belonging**: Hope to gain recognition through sharing food culture and avoid isolation.
* **Practical constraints**: Busy with studies, limited budget, limited kitchen space.

## 2. User Research Interview Questions

* **About eating habits**

  * Do you usually cook in the dormitory? How often?
  * What hometown dish would you most like to share with others?

* **About socializing**

  * Have you ever tried cooking with others? How was the experience?
  * What’s the hardest part about making friends in the dormitory?

* **About bulletin board & activities**

  * If there were a “community recipe board” in the kitchen, would you participate?
  * Would you prefer to share photos, text, or join offline activities?

* **About interaction methods**

  * Do you prefer leaving messages on a physical board or communicating via a mobile app?
  * Would you be interested in signing up for small-scale “Cook Together” events?

## 3. Bulletin Board Design Interface

The bulletin board, as an entry point to the common space, can be designed as a **hybrid physical + digital interactive interface**:

### Bulletin Board Area Concept

1. **Event Announcement Area**

   * Upcoming “Cook Together” activities with QR code for registration.
   * “This Week’s Theme: Breakfast Exchange / Desserts Around the World / Snack Sharing.”

2. **Community Recipe Wall**

   * Students can print/handwrite/paste their hometown recipes (multilingual + with pictures).
   * Matching QR code: scan to get detailed instructions or upload to the App.

3. **Icebreaker Interaction Area**

   * Similar to “question stickers” → students can stick answers under questions like:

     * “Where are you from?”
     * “What spice/snack would you recommend most?”
     * “Want to find someone to go grocery shopping with?”

4. **Kitchen Instruction Area**

   * Dorm kitchen cleaning rules, common kitchenware usage guides.
   * Icons + multiple languages (English + Chinese + other major languages).

5. **Digital Interaction Entry**

   * A large QR code: links to the supporting App or mini program.
   * Slogan: “Scan → Join activities, save recipes, meet neighbors.”

## 4. App/Mini Program Interface

The App doesn’t need to be complex; the core is to complement the bulletin board:

1. **Home: Event Registration**

   * View and register for “Cook Together” events (group dinners, themed cooking classes).
   * Supports tags: vegetarian, halal, nationality-themed.

2. **Recipe Sharing**

   * Browse by nationality/category.
   * Can bookmark, comment, or react with emojis.

3. **Community Interaction**

   * “Find a buddy” feature: people who want to cook/shop together can initiate.
   * Simple instant messaging or groups (avoid becoming another redundant social app).

4. **Notifications & Guidelines**

   * Kitchen cleaning reminders, kitchen booking (if space is limited).
   * Official dormitory announcements.

## 5. Interaction Logic

* **Physical → Digital**

  * Students see recipes/events on the bulletin board → scan QR code to enter App → register/bookmark/comment.

* **Digital → Physical**

  * Students upload recipes in the App → system periodically prints or projects them onto the board → displayed in the kitchen.

* **Instant Socializing**

  * If someone wants to cook together temporarily: can post in the App “Who wants to cook tonight? Let’s share ingredients.”

* **Low-Barrier Participation**

  * No need to download a full App → mini program or web version is more suitable for international students.
