# Interview and Observation Findings

1. 6 out of 10 participants indicated that the kitchen is a “social blind spot” in apartment life. Most rarely use the public kitchen due to shyness and discomfort interacting with strangers, lacking low-pressure opportunities for social engagement.

2. More than half of the students living in studios reported feeling especially isolated, with almost no opportunities to make new friends.

User: “Cooking alone feels boring, but with others it becomes much more enjoyable.”

3. More than half noted that when kitchen activities became overcrowded, they felt uncomfortable or excluded, and they preferred small gatherings instead.

User: “When there are too many people at the activity, I feel awkward and uncomfortable.”

4. 5 out of 10 students stated that they often did not know whether the kitchen was available, or were unclear about activity times and remaining spots, which reduced their willingness to participate.

User: “I often don’t know whether the kitchen is available, so I just give up going.”

5. Passing through the lobby or waiting for the elevator was identified as a potential trigger point, where students’ fragmented moments of time could be used for event promotion and spontaneous participation.

6. 4 out of 10 students found the current sign-up process for activities too complicated (e.g., forms, back-and-forth communication), which lowered their motivation to join.

7. 7 out of 10 students said they would be more motivated to participate if activities combined healthy eating with mutual learning (e.g., sharing recipes, learning healthy dishes).

User: “If there are healthy recipes and I can learn new cooking methods, I’d be more willing to join.”

8. 7 out of 10 students said they would be more motivated to participate if activities combined healthy eating with mutual learning (e.g., sharing recipes, learning healthy dishes).

User: “If I could get a ticket, and even use it later to exchange for a small gift, I’d be more motivated to participate.”
