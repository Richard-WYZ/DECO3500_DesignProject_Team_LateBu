Design projects for DECO3500

# Project State Documentation

## Target Users

**Students living in student accommodation who want to socialize.**

These students often feel isolated in their apartments and seek low barrier opportunities to meet others through shared activities like cooking.

## Process Documentation

### 1. Initial Proposal and Tutor Feedback

- **[Design Proposal](Iteration1/Design_Proposal_Evaluation.md)**:
  Tutor feedback identified key gaps:
  - **Definition**: “Healthy food” was unclear; success metrics undefined.
  - **Clarity**: Engagement and outcomes lacked measurable indicators.
  - **Approach**: Overemphasis on app features, less on behavior and context.
  - **Scope**: Audience definition too broad.
**Outcome**: Required narrowing of target group and clearer user centered framing.

### 2. Refining User Focus

- **[Refinement](Iteration1/Refine_Proposal.md)**:
  - Identified two key groups:
    1. **Food Sharers & Socializers**
    2. **Healthy Eating Learners**
  - Core goal: enable students to share recipes offline and cook together, making healthy eating a social, fun experience.
  - Interview framework redesigned to extract motivations, needs, and pain points.

### 3. Early Interviews and Insights

* **[Interview Analysis](Iteration1/Interview_Analysis.md)**:
  - **Food as a social gateway**: cooking together reduces loneliness and builds friendships faster than dining out.
  - **Cultural exchange**: pride in sharing recipes; curiosity in learning others' food traditions.
  - **Peer influence**: demonstrations inspire healthier eating.
  - **Atmosphere > food quality**: belonging and shared experience matter most.
  - **Challenges**: loneliness, shyness, lack of cooking skills, uncertain ingredients, busy schedules.
  - **User needs**:
    - Low barrier entry points to join kitchen activities
    - Ingredient guidance
    - Simple, social friendly formats

### 4. Iteration 2: Focus on Student Kitchens

- **[Proposal]()**

- **[Further Interviews and Observations](Iteration2/Interview_and_Observation_Findings.md)**:
  - **Kitchen as a social blind spot**: rarely used, avoided due to uncertainty and awkwardness.
  - **Isolation**: particularly strong among studio residents.
  - **Preference for small groups**: overcrowding reduces comfort.
  - **Friction points**: unclear availability, complicated sign up, missed spontaneous opportunities.
  - **Motivators**:
    - Healthy eating with shared learning
    - Incentives like tickets and small rewards
- **[Needs & Pain Points Analysis](Iteration2/User_Needs_Pain_Point_Expectations.md)**:
  Reconfirmed students want kitchens to become **social, manageable, and rewarding**.

### 5. Prototype Development

* **[Prototype](Iteration2/prototype.md)**:
  Focus on **making kitchens more social, engaging, and accessible**.
  **Core Features:**
  - **Homepage**: weekly events, cuisine categories, ticket based entry
  - **Activity Details**: schedules, recipe info, AI driven nutrition analysis
  - **Cooking Process**: step by step guidance, avatars, AI cooking support
  - **End Page**: AI generated digital or printed souvenirs
  **Supporting Functions:**
  - Kitchen reservation system
  - QR code ticketing
  - AI health analysis
  - Real time guidance during cooking
  - Illustrative activity “souvenir” printing
  **Core Flow**: **Reserve → Scan → Cook → Celebrate**

### 6. Prototype Evaluation

* **[Evaluation](prototype_evaluation/Prototype_Evaluation.md)**:


## Key Findings from the Process

- **Awareness & Context Awareness**
  - Students lack real time information on kitchen availability, discouraging use.

- **Collaboration & Mutual Learning**
  - Students want to cook together, learn new recipes, and exchange cultural knowledge, but lack easy channels to initiate.

- **Coordination & Articulation**
  - Current booking and communication processes are too complex, reducing motivation.

- **Conversation & Interaction**
  - Dorm kitchens lack natural, low pressure social interaction points.

- **Presence & Transience**
  - Idle moments (like waiting for the elevator) are underutilized as triggers for engagement.

- **Activity Traces**
  - Students want **public screens** for visibility (activity info) but **private mobile apps** for managing participation.

- **Synchronous / Asynchronous Modes**
  - Students seek both live activities (cooking sessions) and asynchronous contributions (recipe sharing, rating).

- **Context Specific, Location Aware Engagement**
  - Students are motivated when activities connect directly to their immediate environment (e.g., lobby screens, kitchen-specific prompts).

## Current Concept: Kitchen Activity Booking & Recipe Sharing System
- **Lobby based Booking Screen** (location aware and context sensitive)
- **Healthy Recipe Sharing** (upload from phone, linked to kitchen timetable)
- **AI Health Rating** (nutrition evaluation, 1–5 stars)
- **Kitchen Activity Timetable** (availability, participants, spots left)
- **Interactive Ticket System** (drag and print tickets as engagement and proof of participation)

## State of the Project
- Multiple user groups and motivations identified through iterative interviews.
- Core concept evolved from **abstract health focused app** to **concrete, social kitchen engagement system**.
- Documented user needs, pain points, and motivators consistently across iterations.
- Built **prototypes** reflecting real user insights, tested and refined.
- Process and findings are clearly documented in the [github](https://github.com/Richard-WYZ/DECO3500_DesignProject_Team_LateBu), linking interviews, analysis, design refinements, and prototypes.
